# Vulnerability-Management-Analyst

## Objective

I established a comprehensive home-lab environment that utilizes [Nessus Essentials] for vulnerability management. This lab aims to identify, assess, and prioritize vulnerabilities in various systems and applications, allowing for the development of effective remediation strategies. By simulating real-world scenarios, this home-lab helped me enhance my skills in vulnerability scanning, analysis, and reporting, ultimately preparing for a career in cybersecurity.

### Skills Learned
- How to configure Nessus Essentials to perform credentialed vulnerability scans against host systems.

Implemented Vulnerability Management Function on sandbox networks :- Discover, Prioritize, Assess, Report, Remediate, Verify.

Conducted vulnerability assessments with Nessus; remediated vulnerabilities.

Developed automated remediation process to preemptively deal with vulnerabilities stemming from Windows updates and third-party software.

### Tools Used
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
